# Support Tasks

The Support Task module is available outside this project and as it's own documentation https://forge.puppet.com/puppetlabs/support_tasks
each task corresponds to a part of the Puppet Enterprise Knowledge Base (KB# https://support.puppet.com)

The support tasks are included here as some of them are deemed useful for administration and stand alone maintenance and not just when you need help and support.
